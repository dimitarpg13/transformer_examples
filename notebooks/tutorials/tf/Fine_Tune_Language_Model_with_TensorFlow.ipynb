It has one downside, though - if the shape of your input changes at all, then it will need to rerun the compilation again! This isn't a problem for us in this notebook, because all of our examples are exactly the same length. Be careful with it when that isn't true, though - if you have a variable sequence length in your batches, then you might spend more time compiling your model than actually training, especially for small datasets!\n",

This will let you identify the exact line of code where problems arise, but it will significantly reduce your performance, so make sure to remove it again when you've fixed the problem!"

You could also use `return_tensors='tf'` to get TensorFlow tensors, but our TF dataset pipeline actually uses a NumPy loader internally, which is wrapped at the end with a `tf.data.Dataset`.

However, masked language models work great as a base to be fine-tuned further on new tasks, like text or token classification.
